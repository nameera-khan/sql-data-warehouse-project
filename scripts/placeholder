Adding datasets (csv or flat files) in SQL server on macOS requires extentions. The script used can be utilised to create tables, however, that does not work the same way to upload the csv files into the tables. 

This requires downloading docker and connecting the server to the docker container. 

Stored procedure in this setting can only be done after the CSV file has been imported into the SQL server. 

STEP 1: Create the required schema 
STEP 2: Upload all datasets using 'import wizard' by right clicking on the database into the bronze schema
STEP 3: Copy the datasets into Silver schema using the code in 'copy_into_silver_2'
STEP 4: Transform the data in silver schema 
STEP 5: Create stored procedure for future usage using EXEC
