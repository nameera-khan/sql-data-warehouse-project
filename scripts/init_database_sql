/*
To Create database and schemas
=========================================================================
Purpose of script: 
This script assists in the creation of a new database - Data Warehouse - after checking if it already 
exists. If it does exist, for the sake of this project, it is dropped and recreated. The script also showcases 
the creation of 'bronze','silver' and 'gold' schemas. 

WARNING: if this script is being run, it would drop the entire database with the name Data warehouse if it exists. All the data
in the database will be permanently deleted.
